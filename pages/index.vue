      This is a mini database project for the mobile game Assault Lily Last Bullet W (Considered the global version of Assault Lily Last Bullet). 
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose of this project is to act as a small database containing data from the game, including translations of memoria and memoria skills (and possibly other miscellaneous data)
      because while there are websites for the JP version of the game, there doesn't appear to be a website for this version.

      Website Design Look Familiar?

      If you played SINoALICE Global, it's probably not a coincidence :)
